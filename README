Radio controlled arduino quadcopter project

This is very simple arduino quadcopter project.

I recommend opening this with Arduinio IDE 1.0.5 or later

Parts which are required to run this project:
	* Any arduino
	* MPU-6050
	* RC receiver and transmitter
	* 4 motors
	* 4 ESC's
	* A battery
	* And a frame, of course
